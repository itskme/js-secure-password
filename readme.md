# JS Secure Password Manager

I made this secure password manager in JS. 

Passwords only load from the same browser session in which they were saved. The use-case for this tool is short-term storage of encrypted passwords or information. Not long-term because once your browser is reset your saved data will be inaccessible.

Use this tool at your own risk! I am not responsible for lost passwords!
